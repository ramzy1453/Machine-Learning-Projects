class DecisionTreeClassifier(sklearn.base.ClassifierMixin, BaseDecisionTree)
 |  DecisionTreeClassifier(*, criterion='gini', splitter='best', max_depth=None, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, max_features=None, random_state=None, max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0, class_weight=None, ccp_alpha=0.0)
 |  
 |  A decision tree classifier.
 |  
 |  Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <tree>`.
 |  
 |  Parameters
 |  ----------
 |  criterion : {"gini", "entropy", "log_loss"}, default="gini"
 |      The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
 |      "gini" for the Gini impurity and "log_loss" and "entropy" both for the
 |      Shannon information gain, see :ref:`tree_mathematical_formulation`.
 |  
 |  splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
 |      The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
 |      strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
 |      the best random split.
 |  
 |  max_depth : int, default=None
 |      The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
 |      all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
 |      min_samples_split samples.
 |  
 |  min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
 |      The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
 |  
 |      - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
 |      - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
 |        `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
 |        number of samples for each split.
 |  
 |      .. versionchanged:: 0.18
 |         Added float values for fractions.
 |  
 |  min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
 |      The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
 |      A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
 |      least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
 |      right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
 |      especially in regression.
 |  
 |      - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
 |      - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
 |        `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
 |        number of samples for each node.
 |  
 |      .. versionchanged:: 0.18
 |         Added float values for fractions.
 |  
 |  min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
 |      The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
 |      the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
 |      equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
 |  
 |  max_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
 |      The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
 |  
 |          - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
 |          - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
 |            `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at
 |            each split.
 |          - If "auto", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
 |          - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
 |          - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
 |          - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
 |  
 |          .. deprecated:: 1.1
 |              The `"auto"` option was deprecated in 1.1 and will be removed
 |              in 1.3.
 |  
 |      Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
 |      valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
 |      effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.
 |  
 |  random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
 |      Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always
 |      randomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to
 |      ``"best"``. When ``max_features < n_features``, the algorithm will
 |      select ``max_features`` at random at each split before finding the best
 |      split among them. But the best found split may vary across different
 |      runs, even if ``max_features=n_features``. That is the case, if the
 |      improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one
 |      split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour
 |      during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an integer.
 |      See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.
 |  
 |  max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
 |      Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
 |      Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
 |      If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
 |  
 |  min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
 |      A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
 |      greater than or equal to this value.
 |  
 |      The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::
 |  
 |          N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
 |                              - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
 |  
 |      where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
 |      samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
 |      left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
 |  
 |      ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
 |      if ``sample_weight`` is passed.
 |  
 |      .. versionadded:: 0.19
 |  
 |  class_weight : dict, list of dict or "balanced", default=None
 |      Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
 |      If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
 |      multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
 |      order as the columns of y.
 |  
 |      Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be
 |      defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example,
 |      for four-class multilabel classification weights should be
 |      [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of
 |      [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].
 |  
 |      The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
 |      weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
 |      as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``
 |  
 |      For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.
 |  
 |      Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
 |      through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.
 |  
 |  ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
 |      Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
 |      subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
 |      ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
 |      :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.
 |  
 |      .. versionadded:: 0.22
 |  
 |  Attributes
 |  ----------
 |  classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,) or list of ndarray
 |      The classes labels (single output problem),
 |      or a list of arrays of class labels (multi-output problem).
 |  
 |  feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
 |      The impurity-based feature importances.
 |      The higher, the more important the feature.
 |      The importance of a feature is computed as the (normalized)
 |      total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.  It is also
 |      known as the Gini importance [4]_.
 |  
 |      Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
 |      high cardinality features (many unique values). See
 |      :func:`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance` as an alternative.
 |  
 |  max_features_ : int
 |      The inferred value of max_features.
 |  
 |  n_classes_ : int or list of int
 |      The number of classes (for single output problems),
 |      or a list containing the number of classes for each
 |      output (for multi-output problems).
 |  
 |  n_features_ : int
 |      The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.
 |  
 |      .. deprecated:: 1.0
 |         `n_features_` is deprecated in 1.0 and will be removed in
 |         1.2. Use `n_features_in_` instead.
 |  
 |  n_features_in_ : int
 |      Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.
 |  
 |      .. versionadded:: 0.24
 |  
 |  feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
 |      Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
 |      has feature names that are all strings.
 |  
 |      .. versionadded:: 1.0
 |  
 |  n_outputs_ : int
 |      The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.
 |  
 |  tree_ : Tree instance
 |      The underlying Tree object. Please refer to
 |      ``help(sklearn.tree._tree.Tree)`` for attributes of Tree object and
 |      :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tree_plot_unveil_tree_structure.py`
 |      for basic usage of these attributes.

 |  
 |  Notes
 |  -----
 |  The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
 |  (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
 |  unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
 |  reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
 |  controlled by setting those parameter values.
 |  
 |  The :meth:`predict` method operates using the :func:`numpy.argmax`
 |  function on the outputs of :meth:`predict_proba`. This means that in
 |  case the highest predicted probabilities are tied, the classifier will
 |  predict the tied class with the lowest index in :term:`classes_`.

 |      The importance of a feature is computed as the (normalized) total
 |      reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.
 |      It is also known as the Gini importance.
 |      
 |      Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
 |      high cardinality features (many unique values). See
 |      :func:`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance` as an alternative.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
 |          Normalized total reduction of criteria by feature
 |          (Gini importance).

 |  Methods inherited from sklearn.base.BaseEstimator:
 |  
 |  __getstate__(self)
 |  
 |  __repr__(self, N_CHAR_MAX=700)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |  
 |  __setstate__(self, state)
 |  
 |  get_params(self, deep=True)
 |      Get parameters for this estimator.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      deep : bool, default=True
 |          If True, will return the parameters for this estimator and
 |          contained subobjects that are estimators.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      params : dict
 |          Parameter names mapped to their values.
 |  
 |  set_params(self, **params)
 |      Set the parameters of this estimator.
 |      
 |      The method works on simple estimators as well as on nested objects
 |      (such as :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`). The latter have
 |      parameters of the form ``<component>__<parameter>`` so that it's
 |      possible to update each component of a nested object.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      **params : dict
 |          Estimator parameters.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      self : estimator instance
 |          Estimator instance.
